          <h3 className="h3">Design Philosophy</h3>
          <p className="section-text">
          My design philosophy is rooted in the belief that architecture should respond to its context and purpose while embodying a sense of beauty and functionality. I approach each project as a unique opportunity to create something meaningful and enduring.
          </p>
          <p >I believe that architecture is a language that communicates and resonates with people on a visceral level. It should evoke emotions, tell stories, and provide a sense of place. By carefully studying the site, understanding the cultural and historical context, and engaging with the local community, I strive to create designs that are deeply rooted in their surroundings..</p>
